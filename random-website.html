	<b class="a2">Python Vs Java</b>
	<b class="a3">Python has a lot to offer Java developers, and the languages are interesting both in their similarities and their differences.
	The biggest similarity is their “(almost) everything is an object” design and their reputation for excellent cross-platform support, as well as things like immutable strings and deep, relatively standard libraries.
	There are big differences, too. 
	At the community level, Java has always had a single large corporate sponsor. 
	Python support is more distributed. 
	Although both are well within the Algol-like family of languages, Python’s use of syntactically-significant whitespace sets it a little further apart from the mainstream than Java, which is comfortably familiar in its C-like use of braces and semi-colons.</b>
